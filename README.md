How can you combine data science and wrestling? 

By using the Spotify API to analyse the musical features of wrestler's entrance music. 

Using spotify and pandas I have written an algorithm that will take a Spotify playlist and extract the musical features. My plan is to use this data to produce some blog posts and visualisations. Potentially I may investigate the link between a wrestlers music features and their success as a performer
